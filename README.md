# ‚ú® Awesome Panel Examples

A repository of awesome [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) data app examples.

The source files are available in the [src](/src) folder.

The apps are converted to webassembly and released to
[awesome-panel.github.io/examples/](https://awesome-panel.github.io/examples/) as simple as

1. `$ panel convert app.py` (1 second)
2. `$ git push` (1 second)

This is **THE FASTEST WAY TO DEPLOY DATA APPS** in Python.

The apps are **very performant** when loaded because there is no latency for communication between
server and client.

BUT the apps **take time to load** as they need to download a Python runtime and additional packages
(50MB per app).

This is **THE FUTURE OF DATAVIZ** in Python.

If you like [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) and [Awesome Panel](https://awesome-panel.org) please support the projects by giving them a ‚≠ê on Github

## üìô How to

### ‚öôÔ∏è Install the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awesome-panel/examples.git
```

Create and activate a virtual environment, c.f.
[Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

Install the `requirements.txt` file

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -U
```

### üíª Serve a server app locally

You can serve for example the [hello-world](src/hello-world/app.py) application on your Panel server via

```python
panel serve src/hello-world/app.py --autoreload
```

It will be available at [http://localhost:5006/app](http://localhost:5006/app).

### üèóÔ∏è Convert an app to webassembly

You can [panel convert](https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Running_in_Webassembly.html) for
example the [hello-world](src/hello-world/app.py) application to webassembly via

```python
panel convert src/hello-world/app.py --to pyodide-worker --out docs/hello-world
```

If you want to avoid repeating the big download over and over again, you can even convert to a
[progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) that can be installed on
your laptop! It is as simple as adding the `--pwa` and `--title` flags.

Check out the [Panel WebAssembly Guide](https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Running_in_Webassembly.html)
for more details.

### üíª Serve a webassembly app locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

The app is now available at [http://localhost:8000/docs/hello-world/app.html](http://localhost:8000/docs/hello-world/app.html)
